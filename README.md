# JavaEightFeatures, SOLID, Design patterns

Project implmented to practice Java 8 features, SOLID design principles, and Design patterns, all of them divided in the following content:

## Java 8 Features

* Functional programing
* Lambda Expressions
* Functional interfaces
* Predefined Functional Interfaces
    * Runnable, Collection
    * Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier
    * Primitive Predefined Functions
    * Unary and Binary Operations
* Streams
    * Maps, filter, foreach, toCollect
    * Collections
* Constructor and Method Reference (::)
* API Date & Time

##Desing Patterns
The main importance is coupling and cohesion:

* Single Responsability Principle

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

A class (Method, attribute, etc.) has only one responsability, single aim 

* Open Close Principle

A software entity (class, modules, functions) should be open for exteions and close for modifications, using abstract classes or interfaces

* Liskov Substitution Principle

Any child class of a parent class can be sustitued instead of its parent without any unexpected behavior, it can be implemented using heritage

* Interface Segregation Principle

 No class should implement unused methods

* Dependency Inversion Principle

High level classes cant depend of low level classes
